* Introduction

This repository provides an example of how to use [[https://github.com/magit/forge][magit/forge]] to prioritize
GitHub issues. With this code, you can easily view your GitHub issues
in prioritized order on [[https://github.com/magit/forge][magit/forge]] (something [[https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/472][long requested]] for the
GitHub web interface). 

* Usage

To try this out, just load the code in the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emin63/magit-priority-example/main/magit-priority-example.el][magit-priority-example.el]]
file (after setting up [[https://github.com/magit/forge][magit/forge]] for the desired repository), and
call the =forge-list-labeled-issues= method.

For example, if you try this on the [[https://github.com/emin63/magit-priority-example][emin63/magit-priority-example]] and
use =priority:%= for your label, you will get a result like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # Title
    1 [priority:1] describe how to use priority:NUM labels
    2 [priority:2] make some prioritized issues
#+END_EXAMPLE

which shows you all issues with a label that starts with =priority:=
so that you can see prioritized issues. You can click on the =Title=
column to control sorting by ascending/descending priority.
